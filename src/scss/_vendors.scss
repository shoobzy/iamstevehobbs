// Vendors are third-party styles that are being used on a project. Think of things like reset.css, normalize.css,
// or even Foundation and Bootstrap.
//
// The reason these styles are higher up in the structure is so we can override them if needed. As you may recall,
// if the same class is called twice, the cascade will render the properties of the second instance, assuming the
// properties are exactly the same:
// .btn--large {
//     padding: 3em;
// }

//This one wins out
// .btn--large {
//     padding: 5em;
// }
