// A component (namespace: c-) is a small feature that makes up a part of the website. Think buttons, accordions, sliders,
// modal dialogs, etc. Each component is fully functional by itself and does not rely on any other components. This fact
// should be considered when you name the component.
//
// For example, the button in the main section from the example above shouldnâ€™t be called .c-main-button because main
// scopes it inside the main section and limits the use of it in other places, like a sidebar. Something like .c-btn
// is much nicer because the button is no longer tied to any other specific sections of the page.
//
// If you need any extra features, you can always extend properties with a BEM modifier (combining powers!) or use Scope,
// which is coming up in a bit.
